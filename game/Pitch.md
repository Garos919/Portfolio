>
> I’ve been working on a small prototype called **Zone Invaders**, currently at version **0.5.7**.  
> Right now, the gameplay is still **basic and mostly score-based**, but my main focus so far has been on the **aesthetic and overall atmosphere** rather than the full gameplay systems.  
>
> I’ve learned that I work best when something *feels right first* — if it doesn’t connect with me visually or tonally, I lose interest fast. So I spent this phase building the **look, tone, and “soul”** of the game to give it identity before diving deep into mechanics. Now that the aesthetic feels solid, I’m much more motivated to push the gameplay further, and I already have plans for how to make it more engaging and layered.  
>
> I’m **very new to coding** (just entered the Zone01 cohort) and don’t have real experience with **JavaScript, HTML, or CSS** — I built most of this with the help of **GitHub Copilot**.  
> If anyone with more front-end experience wants to take a look at the **GitHub repo**, I’d really appreciate pointers on what might be off, inefficient, or redundant (since Copilot tends to leave outdated or unused snippets).  
>
> For now, I’m mainly looking for **feedback on the aesthetic and feel** — what works, what doesn’t, and what could give the project a stronger identity.
